  ## Installation
 To run this code successfully, you'll need Python installed on your system as well as the 'requests' library. You can install the 'requests' library using pip.

 Once you have Python and 'requests' installed, execute the script in an environment where Python is supported, such as a Python IDE like PyCharm or by running it in the command line.
This code interacts with two APIs, Edamam and Open Food Facts, so an internet connection is required. Upon running, it will prompt for user inputs: cuisine type, ingredient, and product name. Ensure the required inputs are provided as prompted for the script to fetch recipes, cuisine types, and product information.
